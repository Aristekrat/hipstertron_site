		<p>The guy on the bird made this website. <!-- He's the only person behind Hipster Tron. --></p>

		<p>Hipster Tron is his labor of love. Well, actually he missed a show he really wanted to see, got mad about it, and then built this site. So I guess it's a labor of annoyance.</p>

		<p>Anyway, he really likes live music, but sometimes he forgets to check upcoming shows or they're sold out by the time he hears about them. If you are in Denver and like live music too, enjoy this free service.</p>
